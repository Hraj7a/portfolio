  This Python project analyzes retail store performance from 2018 to 2023 using
  data from three text files:
  <br> stores.txt, sales_data.txt, and costs.txt. It organizes data into
  dictionaries by store ID for easy access.<br>

  Key features include:<br>
  <br>
  • Menu-driven interface.
  <br>
  • Calculates average annual sales per store.
  <br>
  • Computes and logs store profits based on sales and costs.
  <br>
  • Identifies the top 3 stores by total sales.
  <br>
  • Rates stores (1–5 stars) based on average monthly sales.
  <br>
  The program uses file handling, loops, conditionals, and exception handling,
  and updates a store_profit.txt file with results. It's a structured,
  interactive
  tool for basic sales data analysis.
